            To travel from shop to shop, we have our legs. To travel from city to city, we have cars. To travel from country to country, we have planes. To travel from planet to planet, we have rockets. But, there’s one place we’ve longed to go to, but never been
            able to: The past and the future<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Technically speaking, the concept of the "present" is a single frame in time that has been extracted to represent the current time you are in. The present lasts precisely 0 nanoseconds, yottaseconds, zettaseconds, etc. Everything around you is either the past or present&mdash;since we know the "Frames Per Second" nature records at is infinite, the amount of time the "present" lasts is 0. A related paradox is mentioned in the post <a href="../understanding-the-impercievable/"><i>Understanding the Impercievable</i></a></span>.
            But, we may now be able to change that. Let’s figure out how.
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, let’s realize what implications time travel may have. For instance, what effect will going back in time and killing your grandfather do? Will future events, the “present” have changed? If you killed your grandfather, your father wouldn’t have
            been born, and neither would you. Would you cease to exist? Or would your grandfather not die at all? Or would the following course of events depend on you travelling back in time and killing your grandfather? These are difficult questions
            to answer; questions that cannot possibly be answered until we time travel (and find someone willing to kill their grandfather, of course).
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let’s move onto the science behind time travel. Is there any way this is actually possible? This entirely relies on the concept of Special Relativity. Imagine that you are on a train, and your friend is on the platform, and the train and the platform
            are in some kind of vacuum. At the front of the train is a headlight that’s turned on. To you, it would seem like the light from the headlight is moving at the speed of \(c + s\), where \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(s\) is the speed of
            the train itself. And… that is a logical explanation isn’t it? If you have a cannon at the front of the train, and you fire the cannon ball out, it’s (initial) speed would be \(s_x + s\), where \(s_x\) is the cannon ball’s normal speed without
            inertia, and \(s\) is the speed of the train itself. But, this only applies to the cannon ball, not to light. That’s why it’s called “special relativity”&mdash;it only applies to specific scenarios.
        </p>

            <figcaption>The scenario discussed above&mdash;a non-accurate representation.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant, about 300 million m/s. So, from your perspective, the speed of light wouldn’t look like it was going at \(c + s\), it would look like it was moving at precisely \(c\), because the speed of light in a vacuum
            is a constant, no matter what perspective you look at it from.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we know that the distance an object has travelled is its speed multiplied by time. In the case of light, the speed is always constant, which means that the other two variables would have to change. When the time changes, it is called time dilation.
            Time dilation, for instance, will occur when another person, your friend (technically referred to as a reference frame) is moving relative to you. So, time, in the perspective of your friend will slow down compared to the time that you measured.
            In this specific scenario, time dilation would be very little, almost negligible. However, if you scaled this up, the difference would be enormous. Say for example that the train you were in was travelling at slightly less than the speed of
            light. Then, time dilation would be very noticeable. And by that, I mean that you could come back 50 years your friend’s junior. So, this means that we can actually escape the cycle of time if we travel fast enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we travelled at the speed of light, rather than slightly less than the speed of light, we would lose no time at all, while more than a hundred years passed outside the time dilation field. So, if we travelled faster than the speed of light, we could
            utilize time dilation to such an extent that it becomes negative! This actually means that we could travel back in time, if we travelled faster than the speed of light.
        </p>

        <p>
            “This is amazing!”, you are probably thinking right now. “Let me pack my bag and go for a trip to the past!” Hold it right there! There are, well, erm, a few, ah, complications. For starters, if you try to reach the speed of light, and even succeed in
            getting very close to it, your mass suddenly starts to get infinite, and so does the energy required to move it. And then, on top of this, the speed of light is also regarded as the speed limit of the universe, nothing moves faster than the
            speed of light.<br><br>

            However, recent evidence has proved that this may not actually be the case. Let’s take, for instance, the photon. The photon is the “particle” on the standard model that represents light. This would mean that it travels at the speed of light. Its mass
            on the standard model is precisely 0. In that case, this would mean that there is no distinction between 0 and infinity. 0 would then, just be an extreme form of \(\infty^{-1}\); the maximum infinity can be extended to. But, there is a loophole
            in this. Scientists have shown that particles called neutrinos can move not only at the speed of light, but also faster than the speed of light. And guess what its mass is? 0? 1? Infinity?
        </p>

        <p>
            Nope. The answer is, <i>at the maximum</i>, 1.1 eV. The muon neutrino is the type of neutrino that has been found moving faster than the speed of light, and it’s mass is &lt;0.17 MeV/c². The Tachyon is an imaginary particle (here, imaginary
            means “existing only in the imagination”), with an imaginary mass (here, on the other hand, imaginary refers to imaginary numbers, on the number line perpendicular to the \(x\) axis). A scientist called Alan Chodos, in 1985, proposed that
            neutrinos could have taychonic nature, as I’ve mentioned above. But because a Tachyon has an imaginary mass, very different from the “real” mass of a neutrino, that would mean that the mass of the neutrino changes. And this is the point where
            we get into advanced quantum electrodynamics that would deter us from the main topic <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Thank god for sidenotes then! The reason people refer to neutrinos not by their types and by the common term "Neutrinos" is because neutrinos have the ability to change ther types as time progresses. This is something the standard model is not able to explain&mdash;why do neutrinos have a mass?</span>            .
        </p>

        <p>
            Regardless, we know that neutrinos, and even photons for that matter (surprise, surprise) have travelled faster than the speed of light in a vacuum because of a little something called Cherenkov Radiation. Cherenkov Radiation is a form of energy loss
            by a particle when it passes the speed of light in that particular medium. Cherenkov radiation is commonly visible, for instance, around nuclear reactors submerged in water.<br><br>
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://media.nature.com/w700/magazine-assets/d41586-019-01430-0/d41586-019-01430-0_16684220.jpg">

        </figure>

        <p>
            This brings us to the idea of “ghost particles”. Tachyonic particles move so fast that they can, at times, move into the past. So the particles that we detect are ghost particles that are visible after the Tachyon has passed. As seen in this image [below],
            two images of the tachyon are visible; the appearing and departing images. Even though the tachyon has crossed the Cherenkov Shockwave into the past, these images are visible, most prominently, to an entity in the path of the superluminal
            particle.

        <p>
            But, let’s say that you do manage to get to the past, bypassing all of these constraints, and breaking the laws of physics. How do you get back to your time, which is now the future? Wel, in order to get to the past, we travelled faster than the speed
            of light. So to travel to the future, we’d just have to do the same thing, except travel slightly slower than the speed of light, depending on how far into the future you need to go. This of course, needs lots of precise calculations. Even
            rounding off a single decimal place can land you a decade or two in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
            But do remember that for now, this is all purely hypothetical. We haven’t managed to even come close to attempt travelling at 50% the speed of light. Our fastest aircraft can barely scrape a tenth of a percent of the speed of light. Who knows, though?
            Maybe sometime in the distant future (or past of the future), we’ll have dozens of tourists lining up to look at the Mona Lisa as it’s being painted! But one thing’s for sure—grammar is going to be a definite problem. I mean, grammar wioll
            haven be a problem! (Reference to <i>The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>)
