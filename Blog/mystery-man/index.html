            Homo Sapiens are the single most intelligent species on planet earth. Or so we think. But, Homo Sapiens are just one of the estimated 2 trillion species that exist here on earth. The chance of humans becoming an intelligent species, therefore, is around
            1 in 1 trillion. The planet we live on—Gaia, or Earth has extremely low odds of being in the orbit it is around the sun, today (And for the past couple billion years). The universe has unbelievably low odds of being capable of supporting the
            already low odds of life in it—much less intelligent life. If the universe’s constants were just 0.0001% off, the universe would become positively curved. And if it was -0.0001% off, negatively curved.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is virtually impossible for such statistically low probabilities to exist—almost negligibly so. It so happens that many constants of the universe cannot be accounted for: They just exist, and have a very specific value. This value has been extremely
            fine-tuned. Just a few decimal points off, as mentioned earlier, could result in a universe with no life in it. Let’s have a closer look at the fine-tuning argument<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">For instance, the speed of light. If the speed of light was slightly off, the speed limit of the universe would be brought down, decreasing the possibility of the big bang synthesizing exactly the amount of matter needed to create life, decreasing the speed of the sun's light, and wrecking the precise science of quantum physics! Phew, that was a long one...</span>.

            Neil Armstrong was 5 feet (ca. 152 centimeters) 11 inches tall at the time of his death. There is a reason we measure his height in feet, rather than light-years. If we said that he was, instead \(2\times10^{-16}\) light years in height, then if he was
            \(2\times10^{-15}\) light years in height or \(2\times10^{-17}\) light years in height, then he would be a dwarf less than 50 cm in height and a 60-foot lumbering giant respectively.
        </p>

            <img src="./images/finetuning.png" width="80%" height="auto">
            <figcaption>A person's height being fine tuned. Notice how the change of a single number by a single digit drastically increases or reduces the man's height.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Another example would be the mass of a neutrino, \(2\times10^{-37}\) kg. You’ll notice that the mass is expressed in kilograms. That way, even if the mass was \(2\times10^{-38}\) kg, atoms would be too heavy to support life. Yes, measuring something this
            small is the equivalent of measuring a person’s height in light years.
        </p>

        <p>
            How lucky are we, exactly, that the mass of a neutrino has exactly thirty-six 0s—no more, no less? The answer is “very lucky”. And this leads to the question—is there some invisible being pulling the strings, tweaking the numbers, so that life can exist?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well—this depends on how you look at it. Because a few of the universe’s constants are different doesn't mean that it cannot support life. That’s like saying a square can only be a square if both of its sides are one meter in length. If only the width
            changed to two meters, it would be a rectangle, but if the length changed to two meters as well, it would still be a square. Thus, there can still be other “configurations” of constants<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Just so you know, many of the things that you consider constants aren't really constants at all. For instance, the speed of light varies—however slightly—based on the medium through which it travels. For more information, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYIbC25GNKs&ab_channel=DoS-DomainofScience">this</a> amazing video.</span>            that still support life.<br><br>

            Physicist Victor Stenger did a study in the year 2000. He picked 4 constants of the universe—electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces, and mass of the electron and the proton—and varied them randomly. He analyzed approximately 100 universes where he
            varied the values by 5 orders of magnitude above and below their actual values. Stegner found that at least 50% of those universes had stars that lasted at least a billion years - enough time for life to evolve. But, a long stellar life is
            not the only requirement for life, it is merely one unusual and important parameter. “There’s more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to build a universe”, says Arvin Ash, YouTube star.

            It may seem almost impossible that such coincidences are possible, but they happen all the time! For instance, read this passage from <a href="www.boredpanda.com">www.boredpanda.com</a>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            A set of twins from Ohio who were separated at birth grew up without any knowledge of each other's existence. Their lives did however share a number of strange similarities. They were both named James on their adoptions, they both grew up to be police
            officers, and both of them married women named Linda. But that's not all. Each had a son, one named James Allan and the other one named James Alan, and each also had a dog named Toy. Both brothers later got divorced, and both ended up remarrying
            women named Betty!
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Just because there is a possibility that god does exist, it does not mean that it is certain that he does exist. As of now, the existence of god cannot be proven, or disproven. Did the universe come into existence because of a set of pre-existing laws,
            or because a pre-existing entity created those laws? We may never know. He may probably never emerge from the constants of the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, if the existence of god was disproved, for instance, would you still believe in him? For that reason, I implore you: Let your faith, if you have one, serve to enrich you, and not take away your wonder and curiosity of the natural world. There’s always
            a certain satisfaction of figuring out the answers to the questions ourselves that no one should be cheated out of. But, until then, keep learning!
