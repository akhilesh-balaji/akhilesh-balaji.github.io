            Time is something that we take for granted. After all, time just seems spontaneous. It cannot be stopped, and it is eternal, in our eyes. There was never a time, so to speak when time was non-existent. But is that really the case. Since we perceive time
            as reality, let us first look at the concept of reality itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            What is reality? Reality is “the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them”, according to the Oxford Dictionary. But this is extremely subjective. You can let your imagination run wild at this point:
            Why not a world which has been programmed by machines, as depicted in the 1999 film <i>The Matrix</i>. Or a universe where you are the only person, other humans just being other entities, as believed by solipsists. The possibilities
            are endless! There is no way of proving what reality is, in reality. That last statement was ironic, and is a paradox in itself. How can we prove what’s real, in reality, without knowing what reality is? A tricky question. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But, aside from the idea of reality not being what we perceive it as, is it possible that the whole idea of reality is non-existent, and exists in only our minds, nothing more than a figment of the imagination? In other words, is reality an illusion?
            Perhaps. But if it was, there would be no way to prove it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let us move on to the second big question, the main idea of this article: If reality is an illusion, is time real? If time was real, then would time also be an illusion? “Our perception of time's flow depends entirely on our inability to see the
            world in all its detail.”, argues physicist Carlo Rovelli. It is impossible to answer these questions without bias. For example, if all of what we have discovered in the field of science is, in reality, merely our own perceptions? But, nevertheless,
            let us try answering this question, from the perspective of science. So to speak, the science that humans have discovered in <i>our</i> perception of reality.
        </p>

        <p>
            To do so, let us unravel the concept of Quantum Uncertainty. The principles of quantum uncertainty revolve around probability and chance. In other words, nothing about the universe is ever predefined, what happens in the future depends entirely on chance.
            The plethora of possibilities for the near future is infinite. Even as you are reading this article, you don’t know what could happen in the next second. You might suddenly rip it apart in a sudden fit of fury as a mosquito bites you, or you
            might put it down to go get some fresh air outside. We also need to know what entropy is. Entropy is commonly regarded as disorder or chaos but is actually a gradual decline into disorder.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, a block of ice has a lower entropy than a glass of water. The disorder in the universe gradually keeps increasing. That’s the reason why glass shatters into shards and not vice versa<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle">
            <span class="sidenote">The laws of Thermodynamics are also an example of entropy. It's why hot things become cold. However, there is data to prove that the thermodynamic arrow of time can  be reserved. This occurs in the quantum realm. If you have any experience with quantum, you'll know that almost any newtonian physics-defying revelations can suddenly spring up. Have a look at <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-correlations-reverse-thermodynamic-arrow-of-time-20180402/">this</a> article to know more.</span>.
            It’s the reason why air shoots out of a punctured tyre and not vice versa. Entropy can be regarded as a scientific concept, as well as a measurable property of a system. The system can be isolated, or compound. Isolated systems are practically
            impossible, but it's possible to get really close. <br><br>
        </p>

            <figcaption>The first half shows us gradual decline into disorder, but the second half is plainly impossible, it shows us the level of entropy declining, which goes against the 2nd law of thermodynamics.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            So what do these two concepts have to do with reality? Quantum uncertainty states that you cannot know the position and speed of all the particles that we have in the universe. Therefore, if we could know them, then that would mean that there would be
            no entropy or disorder. That would also mean that there would be no unravelling of time, as the passing of time is because of entropy. Therefore, we can argue that the passing of time or our perception of its flow is because we are not able
            to know the position and speed of all the particles. This is also what Rovelli argues. Remember, “Our perception of time's flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail.”<br><br>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            But, this is, as I mentioned earlier, an unfair argument, as it has a bias towards our perception of time’s flow. Regardless, in our eyes, time is real, and cannot be stopped with what little technology we have today. So until then, remember that you
            are living in an uncertain world.
