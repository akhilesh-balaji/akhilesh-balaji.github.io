            The year 1943 marked a revolutionary addition to the field of computer science. The world‚Äôs first programmable computer was unveiled to the world. Nicknamed the ‚ÄúColossus‚Äù, this computer spanned the size of an entire room, the walls covered with binary
            switches, giant circuits and capacitors. It was used during WW‚Ö° by the British to decode the German Lorenz cipher. Slowly, as the years passed, the size of computers became smaller and smaller, with our ability to pack circuitry into smaller
            and smaller places. In 2018, the world‚Äôs smallest computer was created, called the ‚ÄúMichigan Micro Mote‚Äù, by students at the Michigan University. This computer was smaller than a grain of rice. This is already starting to get unbelievable.
            However, smaller computers might be on the way. Computers that are smaller than an atom<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Well, this depends. Technically speaking, individual qubits are capable of quantum calculations, but for the right set up, present-day quantum computers are, erm, <i>slightly</i> larger...</span>,
            and are able to perform calculations that would take millions of years to do otherwise. Enter the world of Quantum Computing. <br><br>

            Traditional Computers are based on the idea of transistors, which are tiny gates that allow a particular configuration of information to pass through. This information is stored in the form of bits, which are binary entities. They can either be a 0 or
            a 1. Combinations of these bits can be used to store complex information. For instance, the letter <code>A</code> has an assigned ASCII value of 65. Because we only have 0s and 1s, <code>A</code> can be stored as 1000001, the binary
            value of 65.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lots of transistors put together can create logic gates. For instance, the <code>AND</code> logic gate only produces an output of 1 if both of it‚Äôs inputs are 1. The <code>NOT</code> gate produces 1 if both it‚Äôs inputs are 0. There are over
            7 logic gates in traditional computers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Combinations of these logic gates can let us do complex mathematical operations, starting with addition. If you can add, you can multiply and subtract. From there you can use exponents, integrals, summation‚Ä¶ you name it, and you can do it. These logic
            gate combinations can also let us store data. With a circuit called the ‚Äúflip flop‚Äù, you can store previous inputs and their output. An integrated system of flip flops yields an amazing way to store data. This is what made early computers
            so large. The transistor itself was humongous, and putting together dozens of these transistors to form logic gates, and connecting these logic gates to do operations is bound to take up a lot of space. Now, we understand what a computer is.
            It‚Äôs nothing but one giant circuit. Well, almost. üòÖ
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let‚Äôs apply this knowledge of traditional computers to quantum computers‚Ä¶ Hey! Wait a minute, you can‚Äôt do that! The quantum computer has very different workings. At its base is the qubit, instead of the traditional bit. What, you may ask, makes
            this ‚Äúqubit‚Äù so different from the bit? To answer this, let‚Äôs have a look at the inner workings of Quantum Mechanics. At its core, Quantum mechanics revolves around the (absurdly) absurd properties of subatomic particles. That‚Äôs right&mdash;classical
            physics doesn‚Äôt apply to subatomic particles. In the atom, we have the electrons, protons and neutrons.<br><br>
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MfCHE39YL5jaP9VVb2HeL6-1200-80.jpg">
            <figcaption>A misleading, but simple artistic impression of the atom. This is the Bohr model of the atom, the one you probably saw in your textbook. This model has been disproved, but is used as a way to explain the basic structure of the atom. Refer
                to another blog post for the structure of the atom.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The electron itself is ‚Äúindivisible‚Äù; it‚Äôs a quantum particle that‚Äôs much smaller than the proton and neutron. The constituents of the nucleus, the proton and neutron, conversely, are not quantum particles. They are composed of quantum particles, quarks.
            We won‚Äôt go into what constitutes the quark themselves for now, that would mean taking us into the far away universe of string theory and the quest for the theory of everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            Just like the periodic table of elements in chemistry, quantum physics has its own table. The standard model of elementary particles is a table that has all the elementary, or quantum particles as well as their properties, neatly classified. Unlike the
            118 element long periodic table, the standard model has 17 elementary particles that constitute everything around you. And that is excluding the anti-particles, bringing us to a total of 30 particles. In addition, 6 new particles have been
            proposed to solve inconsistencies within the table. Phew, that‚Äôs a lot of complicated physics, and I promise that we‚Äôll cover it someday.<br><br>
        </p>

            <img src="./images/Standard Model.svg">
            <figcaption>This shows us a version of the standard model that includes the antiparticles in it as well. The SMASH model has not taken the physics world by storm, and has not been proven yet, so I haven't included it here.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Well, quantum particles have a property called superposition. Take for example an Up Quark and a Down Quark. At any point in time, when these particles are not being ‚Äúobserved‚Äù, the quark in question is both Up, and Down at the same time! If we were to
            measure this quark particle, it would exit the state of superposition and become either Up or Down! Weird, right? The same applies to light. Newton, after his observations, proposed the Corpuscular theory, which essentially stated that photons
            were particles, or that light was in the form of particles. Then, along came Thomas Young, who told us that light was in the form of waves. Then, the father of Quantum Mechanics, Werner Heisenberg proved both of these theories right. Light
            is a particle and a wave, be it at the same time, or not. Superposition is a property that applies to all the elementary particles, not just a few.
        </p>

        <p>
            This brings us to the difference between bits and qubits. Qubits can be in a state of \(\textstyle |0\rangle\), \(\textstyle |1\rangle\)<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle">
            <span class="sidenote">
                The wierd \(|\cdot\rangle\) here is called "Bra-ket" notation. In this case, this specific notation is a Ket. A Bra would be something like \(\langle \cdot|\) This notation means that the qubit state is a Ket vector, a slightly different kind of
                vector, that only applies to Hilbert Space. Quantum states aren't just numbers, they are vectors. I won't go in depth about them, but you can do some research about this.
            </span>, or superposition \(\textstyle |\psi\rangle\), exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be stored. When I say \(\textstyle |0\rangle\) or \(\textstyle |1\rangle\), these values can be assigned to the
            qubit‚Äôs spin, rotation, or charge. Due to this property, a set of 20 qubits can store up to a million values in parallel. This makes them unimaginably powerful. Thus, the states of a qubit can be represented using the following Dirac Notation.
            It shows us a \(1 \times 2\) matrix. \[{\displaystyle |0\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |1\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}}}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, different qubits can be entangled, or linked, via a quantum phenomena called Quantum Entanglement.. In this phenomena, a property of each qubit is linked together in a particular way, ensuring that a change in the value of one instantly reflects
            in the other, even if it‚Äôs at the opposite end of the universe. When two qubits are entangled, let us take their states as \(\psi_A\) and \(\psi_B\). Here, \(A\) and \(B\) represent the seperate Quantum systems. Then, we can say that: \[{\displaystyle
            \psi _{A}\otimes \psi _{B}}\] Which means that the states of both qubits are entangled by the \(\otimes\) symbol, which we'll get to in a while.

            Because they are this powerful, 250-digit long RSA codes<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">RSA is a system used for safe data transcriptions. It involves a public, and private key, both of which are <code>&lt;insert big number here&gt;</code> digit long prime numbers, that would take very long to crack. This makes it very powerful.</span>,
            which would otherwise take years to crack by factoring out, can be done in the blink of an eye by a quantum computer. This also shows us how they can be a threat to human kind. After all, we don‚Äôt want unbelievable powerful computers smaller
            than an atom hacking into the Pentagon‚Äôs confidential database in the blink of an eye.<br><br>

            <figcaption>IBM has developed a quantum computer. As seen in the image, as of now, they really aren't that small. Much of the apparatus here is simply the cooler, needed to get the computer to the right temperature. Google and Microsoft have also succeesed
                in building quantum computers, among other companies.</figcaption>

        <p>
            The increased number of states also opens the door for new types of logic gates, called quantum gates, that can perform operations otherwise impossible on a traditional bit. To proceed any further, let‚Äôs understand the idea of a Bloch Sphere, which is
            a two-dimensional probabilistic representation of a qubit. The points on the surface (\(z\) and \(-z\) represent \(\textstyle |0\rangle\) and \(\textstyle |1\rangle\) respectively) signify the exact values of \(\textstyle |0\rangle\) or \(\textstyle
            |1\rangle\), while the area in between, or inside the sphere, tells us the probability of the sphere being either \(\textstyle |0\rangle\) or \(\textstyle |1\rangle\), depending on the property assigned to it.<br><br>
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./images/Bloch_sphere.png" width="45%">
            <figcaption>The Bloch Sphere. It may look complex, but it's not. Well, not <i>very</i> complex</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Here‚Äôs an example of a Quantum Gate: The Hadamard gate, represented by \(H\). This is a very interesting gate, and probably the most useful. What the Hadamard Gate does is to create a superposition of a qubit by ‚Äúrotating‚Äù the Bloch sphere on the \(x\)
            axis, and then on the \(y\). This creates superposition of the qubit. Remember that the Bloch sphere is just a (close to) accurate, but simplified representation of a qubit, and rotating the Bloch sphere isn‚Äôt the same as rotating the qubit
            itself. And then we have the slightly simpler \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) gates that rotate the Bloch sphere on the respective axes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's what a circuit that creates superposition between qubits would look like. It's one of the most basic circuits, really. The \(H\) gate creates superposition on qubit \(q[0]\).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./images/superpositiongraph.png" width="40%">
            <figcaption>The circuit that creates superposition of qubits.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            What's interesting is that the moment we measure the state of \(q[0]\), it collapses into the state of 0. So I'm going to show you the probability result of this superposition <i>without</i> the measurement, to properly illustrate quantum
            superposition.
        </p>

            <figcaption>In this graph, we see the probability distribution of being in either state, which is 50%. Thus, the qubit is in superpostion, created using the Hadamard gate.</figcaption>

            We‚Äôve only covered the sheer basics of quantum computing here, there‚Äôs a whole universe of quantum computing ahead of us. Literally. You can experiment with quantum computing online with IBM Quantum Experience. IBM has hooked up multiple 5-qubit quantum
            computers to the web that you can experiment with. Try out the different gates, observe the changes that happen, and quantum computing will suddenly seem a lot less daunting because of ‚ÄúThe Dreaded Q-word‚Äù.
