            What is a dimension? You may have heard this word being thrown at you in various different contexts: From Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, to measuring the amount of carpet needed to cover the floor of a room. Simply put, a dimension is an aspect, or
            perspective of looking at things. There are many dimensions, almost an infinite number of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, when we observe these dimensions from a mathematical perspective, we like to organize them based on how many ways you can measure an object in that dimension. We will start from the beginning, the zeroth dimension. As the name implies, this dimension
            does not have any way to measure an object in it. Thus, the only object that can exist in the zeroth dimension is a point that takes up no space at all, and therefore has no mass. This point has no shape either. Now, imagine these points stacked
            up on top of each other, infinitely. What do you get? You get a line. A line has only a length, and 0 thickness. What we have here is the first dimension.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, imagine these lines stacked together on one axis, infinitely. You get a two-dimensional object. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, let us assume that we get a square. This square has length and width, but no thickness. From a scientific perspective, it is
            impossible for a two-dimensional object to exist in a three-dimensional world, because everything, from a piece of paper to aluminum foil has thickness, however negligible. Three dimensions, on the other hand, are essentially many two-dimensional
            objects stacked up to create the last dimension that we can perceive, height. These three dimensions are commonly referred to as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). It seems almost paradoxical how an object of zero thickness can be stacked up, however
            infinitely, to create an object with one extra dimension.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though we are three-dimensional creatures, have you ever noticed that we cannot perceive the third dimension in its entirety? Even when we look at a three-dimensional object, we are only able to perceive its two-dimensional projection on a flat plane,
            the same way a wall captures our shadows. The same way, a two-dimensional creature would only be able to perceive a cross-section of a two-dimensional object, which, in this case, is a line. As the object moved closer to the creature, the
            line would appear to get longer and longer. If this line was growing proportional to the speed it went backwards, then the object would appear stationary. This is an illusion which can occur in the three-dimensional realm as well. Thus, a
            one-dimensional being would be able to see - nothing, because there would be nothing to see in the Zeroth dimension.<br><br>

        <p>
            By the same logic, a four dimensional being would be able to see in three dimensions, which means that it would be able to see through things, above things, into things, and outside things, at the same time. Scientists also argue that three-dimensional
            objects are actually 4 dimensional shadows. But, what would you see if you managed to get into a four dimensional world? For the first few paragraphs, I navigated from a point to a line to a square to a cube. All of these are called ‚Äúhypercubes‚Äù.
            For instance, a line is a one-dimensional hypercube, and a cube is a three-dimensional hypercube.
        </p>

        <p>
            A four dimensional hypercube would be something called a tesseract. The tesseract would essentially be a cube at right angles with another cube. Explaining it in three-dimensional terms, a tesseract would be a cube with its corners connected to another
            cube. The tesseract you see on this page, then is a two-dimensional drawing of a three-dimensional projection of a four dimensional cube. The tesseract can essentially be broken up of subfacets, or lower-dimensional components: 16 vertices,
            or points, 32 edges, or line segments, 24 squares, or facets, 8 cubes, or cells, and 1 tesseract, or terra. The cube is the center is actually the same size as the cube on the outside, but it is further behind in four-dimensional space, making
            it appear smaller in its three-dimensional shadow.

        </figure>

        <p>
            The image of a rotating tesseract (above) looks weird, right? This is because its rotation looks deformed, or distorted to us, because we, puny three-dimensional beings are unable to perceive the magnitude of the four-dimensional realm. And remember:
            the four-dimensional can only be perceived by beings from the fifth dimension or higher. The penteract would only be visible to six, or higher dimensional beings, the sexteract would only be perceivable to seven, or higher dimensional beings,
            and the dekeract would only be perceivable to eleven, or higher dimensional beings.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But that‚Äôs not all! A hypercube is just one of the many types of higher-dimensional geometries. For example, the hypersphere is a generalization of the circle and sphere to higher dimensions. So, in the fourth dimension, a hypersphere would be a ‚Äúglome‚Äù,
            and in the fifth dimension, a ‚Äúhyperglome‚Äù. On top of those, there are simplexes (Triangle, Tetrahedron, Pentachron, etc) and cross polytypes (Octahedron, Hexadecachoron, Pentarss, etc).<br><br>

        <p>
            Just imagine how much more intellectually capable higher-dimensional beings might be! They have extra dimensions to make neuron connections. Why, our own brains may be wired through the fourth dimension! Overall, higher-dimensional mathematics is a promising
            new field, and why might never be able to completely unravel it, judging by the sheer effort of trying to imagine three-dimensional projections of higher-dimensional objects. Who knows? Higher dimensions may be the true nature of reality.
