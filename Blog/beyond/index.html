            In a puny spiral galaxy called the Milky Way, there exists a tiny star system, which houses a trivial blue planet called Earth. Upon its surface walk a unique species of primate called Homo Sapiens, one of the trillion or so other life forms on its surface.
            This diminutive race may be one of many in the vast universe, perhaps even multiverse. Humanity, you might think, is considerably advanced: We have gone from harnessing fire to towering metropolises that scrape the stratosphere. But what humanity
            has achieved is barely an atomâ€™s width in relation to the Burj Khalifa, in comparison to what civilizations are believed to be able to reach, or have already reached.

            Enter the world of the Kardashev scale. This scale was invented by Nikolai Semenovich Kardashev in 1963. Kardashev said that there were three different stages to civilization (at least, the original scale had three different stages), organized based on
            how they could harness the surrounding resources.<br><br>

        <p>
            In the first stage of civilization, they are able to harness all the resources on their home world: This doesnâ€™t just mean mining every ounce of natural gas, coal, and oil out of the planet, it also means harnessing every gust of wind, every photon that
            hits the earth, every wave in the oceans, and all the heat in the planetâ€™s core<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">While the Kardashev scale tells us that we have to go on with the rapid decimation of the planet, climate change scientists tell us how we are bringing down the planet's supply of resources, and how we should stop doing it. What a juxtaposition of ideas! Should we go on destroying the world to become Type 1 civilizations, or should we stay stuck at our current stage, perhaps even moving backward on the scale?</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            When theyâ€™ve exhausted their home world of all its resources, a civilization may feel the need to use the resources from its neighboring planets, and home star. It was a big enough deal extracting resources from their home planet, but how do you extract
            resources from an entire star system? Well, thatâ€™s the fun in Type two. Letâ€™s look at the star itself, first. Freeman Dyson proposed a method for extracting energy from an entire star, in 1960. This method involved a huge megastructure built
            around a star, to harness the heat and light coming off it. <br><br>
        </p>

            <figcaption>This is an artist's impression of a dyson sphere. It involves constructing a giant megastructure around the sun in order to collect energy from it.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Building this would require a monstrous, even demonic, amount of resources to build, that would drain the entire solar system of its resources (excluding the sun). This legendary idea was called the Dyson Sphere, and this is something that no Type two
            civilization would be complete without. A Dyson Sphere is a Class B stellar engine. Stellar engines are essentially hypothetical megastructures powered by the sun, used for various purposes. For instance, a Shkadov thruster is used for propelling
            an entire star system, while a Matrioshka brain is for computational purposes. Of course, no planet would be habitable by the time the giant structure was built, so humans (If humans are still humans and not another species
            <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle">
            <span class="sidenote">There are two possibilities here. a) Humans might have just evolved into another species in the time period that they took to become Type 2 civilizations; b) The Humans living on different planets evolved into different species to better suit those climatic conditions; and c) Both a) and b). The irony is that the "Type 2 civilization" may not even be the same civilization it was when it was a Type 1. Be confused... <i>Very</i> confused... ðŸ˜‰</span>)
            might have to live in giant space stations, such as an Alderson Disk, or an O'Neill Cylinder. These are essentially huge space stations that are able to support life, in the shape of a disk and a cylinder respectively. Cooper station in the
            movie <i>Interstellar</i> is an example of an Oâ€™Neill Cylinder.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we are getting into the kind of development that is unimaginable to Humankind; itâ€™s on such a large scale. We are now in the third stage of the Kardashev scale. This is the kind of level where a civilization controls and harnesses energy from an
            entire galaxy. How do you set about doing this? Well, first, you would need to harness the energy from every single star in the galaxy. 100 thousand million Dyson spheres doesnâ€™t sound that bad, does it? (Spoiler alert: ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±)
        </p>

        <p>
            A Type three civilization might be able to tap into the energy and gravity of the black hole that is at the center of most galaxies! In the Milky Way, the black hole is called Sagittarius A*. Theoretical white holes are also another example of how a Type
            three civilization might be able to harness energy&mdash;white holes are the theoretical opposite of black holes: They spew out energy continuously, but donâ€™t take anything in.<br><br>
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
            Kardashevâ€™s original scale ends thereâ€”but scientists have continued to propose more and more stages, the most common one having 5 stages, and others having 7. Type 4 civilizations, theoretically, should be able to control the entire universe, and Type
            5 civilizations can access energy from the entire multiverse! Further, many scientists have proposed a Type á˜¯ civilizationâ€”this is the highest possible stage of civilization in the Kardashev scale. Beings of such scale would have enormous
            power. If there are any creators of the universe, as such, then they are probably it. This means that if you were born a couple billion years from now, you might have had the opportunity to "meet your Maker". Literally.
        </p>

        <p>
            Physicist Michio Kaku has put us on Type 0.72 of the scale. So, weâ€™ll probably reach Type one in another 100 to 200 years. Comparing us to Type á˜¯ beings is like comparing microbes on an ant hill to Type 2 civilizations. Perhaps Type á˜¯ civilizations have
            succeeded in building a Matrioshka Brain, and we are nothing more than a simulation in it. They might even have the ability to harness the energy in Dark matter and energy!
        </p>

        <p>
            Physicist John Barrow also proposed a micro dimensional version of the scale, revolving their abilities to manipulate their environment. These stages of civilization go backwards, as they get more and more precise. Type 1-minus beings are capable of manipulating
            matter, Type 2-minus beings are capable of manipulating their genes, Type 3-minus beings are capable of manipulating molecules, and molecular bonds, to create new molecules, and Type 4-minus beings are capable of manipulating atoms themselves,
            to create atomic-level nanotechnology. Type 5-minus beings are able to change the composition of the atomic nucleus, and the particles that compose it, and Type á˜¯-minus civilizations can manipulate and twist the very fabric of space-time.
            Humans are Type 1-minus beings on the Kardashev micro dimensional scale.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Pre-planetary, Planetary, Stellar, Galactic, Intergalactic, Universal, Multiversal, and Omniversalâ€”the six (or so) stages of the Kardashev scale. If such civilizations are out there, why havenâ€™t we detected traces of them? We wouldnâ€™t be able to detect
            traces of Type 4 and above civilizations, because their activity would merge with that of nature itself: If you were to harness dark energy, your activity would appear like the activity of dark energy itself! But what about Type 3 and below?
        </p>

        <p>
            Why arenâ€™t we able to detect traces of such civilizations? A Type 2 or above would have been able to build a Dyson Sphere. So, wherever you find a Dyson Sphere, aliens are sure to follow. Scientists are actually doing this, by analyzing the light patterns
            in different starsâ€”but of no avail. We must conclude that higher level civilizations do not exist. But, is there a chance they could have existed? If so, probably not in our corner of the galaxy. We will surely have chanced upon mega structures
            left to ruin in the dark void of outer space. But, until we can find a Type á˜¯ civilization to tell us all the answers, youâ€™ll have to figure them out on your own. Stay curious!
