We created a browser extension, written in traditional web development tools, that would assist students in the management of their time effectively, such that they could complete each of their tasks based on which one was most important. This was done taking into account the total screen time that each task would add up to, so that we could provide eye and mindfulness breaks in between. One of the hardest parts about creating this was programming the algorithm to order tasks, and decide on the amount of time required for each task.'

Of the three themes offered to us, we picked 'Responsible consumption and production.' In accordance with aforesaid theme, our product was a carbon footprint tracker that aimed to motivate the user to reduce their carbon footprint to as low as it could possibly be, taking into account the food that they consumed, how they travelled, &c. The hackathon helped build my collaboration skills as the team leader, working effectively and co-operatively towards a single goal."

The first consisted of climate change-themed science challenges which were time-bound and had to be solved using Python within 10 minutes. After we passed this round, we were instructed to create a video about how a particular country was implementing the UNSDGs, which had to be done at night. Specifically, the time alloted was 10:30 PMâ€“12:30 AM. Then, we had to present this video to the judges, and they asked us questions about the presentation. Overall, it was an enriching experience.
